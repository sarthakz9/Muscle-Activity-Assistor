Muscle activity assistor
This project will help to develop an open source solution for creating a medical device which in theory will be able to help people with diseases like Parkinson to better control their movements.

Goal: 

To be able to amplify and damp muscle movement to give precise intended body movement for patients with weaker Neuron activity. For example Parkinson Patients, Which do have some Neuron activity instead of none, which is in the cases of Spinal cord injury patients.

There are 3 basic requirements for the project
1. To be able to read muscle activity with very high accuracy.
2. To be able to contract and relax individuals muscles using external stimulus.
3. To be able to predict muscle activity for a short interval in the future (10-100 ms) using the muscle activity data from the previous interval of (1-2s)

Research:

is there a way to control human muscles from external stimulus?
electrical muscle stimulation (EMS), application of electrical currents to the muscles in order to cause them to relax or contract

Can electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) be used in such a way that it can be used to make very specific accurate muscle movements?
functional electrical stimulation (FES): which involves applying electrical currents to specific muscles in order to produce a desired movement

Is there a way to read muscle activity using external body tools?
electromyography (EMG) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sK065oV8_4w

is there a way to damp excess muscle activity using external tools?
 electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) can also be used to enable muscle relaxation probably.

how much voltage and current is required for EMS electrical muscle stimulation?
50-500 microvolts or 1-500 milliamps depending on size and type of the muscle being stimulated

Pending actions:

* Check with at least one medical professional to analyse the feasibility of the project [?]
* Find a device capable of reading muscle activity. [?]
* Analyse the muscle activity data and do a POC to test wether the prediction step is even possible or not. [-]
    * Prediction step may require a AI based solution or just extrapolation? [?]
* Identify how muscles come into relaxed state from contracted state. [?]
* Validate that if all of the 3 requirements are fulfilled then, the project can be helpful in assisting with some of the body functions of day to day life. [?]
* Setup an open source project [-]
    * A GitHub repo for software related contributions [x]
    * A Discord channel for creating a community of medical and software professionals [?]
